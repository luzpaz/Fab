<p>Embed: Embedded FreeCAD Python Mode</p>
<p>FreeCAD can be run in &quot;embedded mode&quot;, which basically means running without bring up
the FreeCAD Gui.</p>
<p>The amount of code involved is quite trivial:</p>
<pre><code> import sys
 sys.path.append(&quot;.&quot;)
 import Embed
 Embed.setup()
</code></pre>
<p>That's it.  The explanation of what embedded mode is and the various things required
to make it work discussed below:</p>

<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Introduction</h2>
<p>It is totally awesome that FreeCAD exposes a much of its internals via Python interfaces.
There are multiple ways of accessing these FreeCAD Python interfaces.
The pros and cons of each FreeCAD Python access method are discussed in this document.</p>
<p>This document is Linux focused, since the original author uses neither Windows nor MacOS.</p>
<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The FreeCAD and FreeCADGui Modules</h2>
<p>There are two top level modules in FreeCAD:</p>
<ul>
<li>FreeCAD:
This module is the top level module primarily for managing FreeCAD geometry.
This module is typically abbreviated as App (e.g. <code>import FreeCAD as App</code>.)</li>
<li>FreeCADGui:
This module is used for accessing the GUI (Graphical User Interface)
presentation issues such as visibility, transparency, color, views, etc.
This module is typically abbreviated as Gui (e.g. <code>import FreeCADGui as Gui</code>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If your code is doing 100% geometry and does not care about visualization, only the FreeCAD
module needs to be imported.  The FreeCAD module is traditionally imported as:</p>
<pre><code> import FreeCAD as App
</code></pre>
<p>The FreeCADGui module is concerned with visual presentation of the FreeCAD display tree.
When the FreeCAD program application is up and running, all Python GUI manipulation features
are enabled.  The FreeCADGui module is traditionally imported as:</p>
<pre><code> import FreeCADGui as Gui
</code></pre>
<p>When the FreeCADGui module is imported into a stand alone Python interpreter outside of the
FreeCAD user interface python interpreter, it is has essentially no useful functionality.</p>
<h2>FreeCAD Macros</h2>
<p>The most common way of importing Python code into a FreeCAD Python environment is
via FreeCAD macros.
A FreeCAD macro is basically Python program that typically has either <code>.py</code> suffix or
the more common (for FreeCAD) <code>.FCMacro</code> suffix.
The most common place where macro files reside is in the <code>~/.FreeCAD</code> directory,
where <code>~</code> stands for current user home directory on Linux.
All of the macros in this directory are available via the [Macro] tab
at the top line of FreeCAD window.</p>
<p>It is also possible to directly execute a Python program via:</p>
<pre><code> freecad19 my_code.FCStd
</code></pre>
<p>This will bring the FreeCAD application and execute the Python code in <code>my_code.FCStd</code>.
Once the code in <code>my_code.FCStd</code> has some executed,
the FreeCAD application can be used to inspect the results of the code execution.
It is possible to add a small piece of code at the end of <code>my_code.FCStd</code> that
saves out its results into a <code>.FCstd</code> document and then shuts down the FreeCAD application.
In this situation, the FreeCAD application pops up a window, runs <code>my_code.FCStd</code>,
and then shuts down the application window and exits.
In this mode, Python code must be run on a machine with display,
since it will not successfully run on a headless machine.</p>
<p>One final comment is that many editors look at the file suffix to enable Python mode
(e.g. color highlighting, automatic indentation, etc.)
Python code with a <code>.FCStd</code> will typically not enable Python mode.
A clever solution is to add a symbolic link (e.g. <code>ln -s my_code.FCStd my_code.py</code>)
and point the editor at the <code>.py</code> file.</p>
<p>Another note is that neither the FreeCAD application nor the FreeCAD console
(see section immediately below) honor the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable.
This is deliberate and ensures that is the exact same Python environment is alway used
and that it is not effected by other Python applications that require PYTHONPATH
modifications to properly operate.
The workaround is add code to explicitly modify <code>sys.path</code> as discussed a bit further below.</p>
<h2>Standalone FreeCAD Console</h2>
<p>It is also possible to directly bring up the FreeCAD console by:</p>
<pre><code> freecad19 -c
</code></pre>
<p>This brings up a standard Python configured with access to all of the FreeCAD python modules.
In this mode,
the FreeCADGui module can be imported (i.e. <code>import FreeCADGui as Gui</code>),
but it has much reduced functionality.
Running <code>dir(Gui)</code> in this mode will show a very minimal list of attributes/methods.
The current Gui methods are <code>embedToWindow</code>, <code>exec_loop</code>, <code>setupWithoutGUI1, and </code>showMainWindow<code>. In general, no attempt should be made to do GUI operations from this console session. The </code>App.GuiUp<code>attribute is</code>True<code>when the GUI is available and</code>False` otherwise.</p>
<p>To list all of the available modules available to import in this environment type:</p>
<pre><code> sorted(tuple(sys.modules.keys()))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>~/FreeCAD</code> directory is in the default path for the console.
Thus, any Python modules (i.e. has a <code>.py</code> suffix) in this directory are available for importing.
The files ending with a <code>.FCMacro</code> suffix are not importable.</p>
<h2>FreeCAD in &quot;Embedded Mode&quot;</h2>
<p>In &quot;embedded mode&quot;, a standard Python interpreter is run and it is configured to be able
access all of the FreeCAD modules.
By using a standard Python interpreter,
it is possible add additional needed packages and modules using <code>python3 -m pip install ...</code>.
For example, it is possible to install debugger, test suite harness, code coverage, etc.</p>
<p>Since Python is constantly adding and deprecating features,
it is important use to run a Python with the same major and minor version numbers.
In order get the version information, type the following into the Python console:</p>
<pre><code> import sys
 sys.version_info
 # Should print something like &quot;sys.version_info(major=3, minor=8, micro=5, ...&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Only the <code>major</code> and <code>minor</code> version matter.
This should be done using the both FreecCAD console (i.e. <code>freecad19 -c</code>) and
another Python interpreter (i.e. <code>python3</code>).</p>
<p>Next, it necessary to find a consistent FreeCAD system.
One possibility is to download and build FreeCAD from source.
However, it is probably easier is to just download one of the FreeCAD AppImage's,
and extract the required files.
For example:</p>
<pre><code> freecad19 --appimage-extract
</code></pre>
<p>will create the <code>squashfs-root</code> directory that contains consistent files.
All of the relevant files are in <code>squashfs-root/usr/lib</code> which can readily
be added to the python interpreter path.</p>
<p>The are two ways to get <code>squashfs-root/usr/lib</code> into the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The easiest way is to simply add <code>squashfs-root/usr/lib</code> to the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
environment variable:</p>
<pre><code> export PYTHONPATH=&quot;$PYTHONPATH:squashfs-root/usr/lib&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python code can be used to accomplish the same task:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append(&quot;./squashfs-root/usr/lib&quot;)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of the two methods, the <code>sys.path.append</code> method is preferred because not everybody
will remember to set up PYTHONPATH beforehand.</p>
<h2>Dual Mode FreeCAD Python Programs</h2>
<p>A dual mode Python program is one can be run as both FreeCAD macro and in embedded mode.
The idea is shown immediately below:</p>
<pre><code> # Create my_code.py
 ln -s my_code.py my_mycode.FCMacro  # Make a symbolic link for my_code.FCMacro
 python3 my_code.py                  # Run mycode.py in embedded mode
 freecad19 mycode.FCMacro            # Run mycode.FCMacro through the FreeCAD application
</code></pre>
<p>The first run will produce all of the geometry and second one has access to the FreeCADGui
module and can add additional presentation information.</p>
<p>There needs to be a preamble in <code>mycode.py</code> that sets up the paths.
This code looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code> import os
 import sys

 assert os.version_info.major == 3, &quot;Python 3.x is not running&quot;
 assert os.version_info.minor == 8, &quot;Python 3.8 is not running&quot;
 sys.path.extend([os.path.join(os.getcwd(), &quot;squashfs-root/usr/lib&quot;), &quot;.&quot;])

 import FreeCAD as App  # type: ignore
 import FreeCADGui as Gui  # type: ignore
 # Note: App.GuiUp is only True when Gui is actually active.
</code></pre>
<p>The following piece of code will exit the window system when the GUI is up:</p>
<pre><code> # It might make sense to save any open documents before exiting.
 if App.GuiUp:
     Gui.getMainWindow().close()
</code></pre>
<p>When the python version changes the followning packages need to be intalled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>python3.9 -m pip install shiboken</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>python3.9 -m pip install PySide2 setuptools</p>
</li>
